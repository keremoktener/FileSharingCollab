# Security Measures for File Sharing Application

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the File Sharing Application to ensure that user data and files remain secure.

## Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Authentication**: The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, with tokens that expire after 24 hours.
- **Enhanced JWT Claims**: Each token includes a unique ID and user roles for better validation and tracking.
- **Strong Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using BCrypt with appropriate work factors.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Files can only be viewed, downloaded, or modified by their owners.

## Data Protection

- **File Soft-Delete**: Files are never permanently deleted immediately; they are marked as deleted and can be recovered if needed.
- **Secure File Access**: Files can only be accessed through authenticated API endpoints that validate the user's identity.
- **Content-Type Validation**: The application validates and restricts file types to prevent malicious file uploads.

## API Security

- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-Site Request Forgery protection is enabled for all endpoints except file uploads and authentication.
- **CORS Configuration**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is configured to allow only specific trusted origins.
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP rules are defined to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Secure Headers**: HTTP security headers are set including:
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store
  - Strict-Transport-Security

## Deployment Security

- **HTTPS Only**: In production, all communication is encrypted using HTTPS.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration like JWT secrets and database credentials are stored as environment variables.
- **Cookie Security**: Cookies are marked as secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite=Strict.
- **Production-Specific Configuration**: A separate application-prod.properties file enables additional security features in production.

## Secure File Viewing

- **Authenticated Blob URLs**: For file previews, we use authenticated API calls to fetch file data and create local blob URLs rather than exposing direct file links.
- **Memory Management**: Blob URLs are properly revoked after use to prevent memory leaks.

## Recommendations for Deployment

1. **Use Environment Variables**: All sensitive configuration should be set using environment variables.
2. **Set Up HTTPS**: Configure a valid SSL certificate for your domain.
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated to minimize vulnerability risks.
4. **Security Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to detect unusual access patterns.
5. **Backup Strategy**: Implement regular database and file backups.

## Security Limitations and Future Improvements

- **File Encryption**: Currently, files are stored unencrypted. Future versions will implement at-rest encryption.
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting should be implemented to prevent brute force attacks.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Future versions will support MFA for additional security.
- **Audit Logging**: More comprehensive audit logging for security events.
